# Employee-Management-System

Hello Connections, I'm glad to share that I've been working on an Employee Management System.

ðŸ”¹This system built using Java, allows seamless management of employees within an organization. It offers a range of functionalities to handle employee data efficiently.

ðŸ”¸ Adding and removing employees is a effortless and finding employees by ID or name is just a few clicks away. The system provides detailed employee profiles, including their ID, name, and salary.

ðŸ”¹ It's easy to perform salary-related operations as well. You can update an employee's salary, check if it exceeds a certain amount, or find employees within a specific salary range. The system even identifies the employees with the highest and lowest salaries, helping with decision-making processes.

ðŸ”¸This system calculates the total salary cost and it also offers a smooth experience, with features like clearing all employee data and verifying employee existence within the system.

ðŸ”¹If you're interested in trying it out, feel free to check out the code below! I'd love to hear your feedback and any improvements you might have.
